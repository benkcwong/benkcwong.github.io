# About Me

I am a global health epidemiologist with training in public health, biostatistics, and experimental design. I am interested in using data to generate reliable evidence that improves decision-making, health system performance, and population health in low- and middle-income settings. My current work focuses on using data science to understand trends in maternal and child health, vaccine-preventable diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tobacco/alcohol control. 

I like data analysis, cool visualizations, guitar, coffee (lots!) and communicating science to a broader audience.
