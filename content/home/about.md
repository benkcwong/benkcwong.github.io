# About Me

I am an Epidemiologist at the Centre for Global Health Research in St. Michael's Hospital. We generate and disseminate evidence-based research quantifying the major causes of premature mortality among the world's poorest populations. Our research areas include maternal and child health, gender inequalities, tobacco control, and health policy/economics.

This is my (not-so-private) hideaway for tinkering with data analysis and visualization, as well as communicating science to a broader audience.

I'd love to hear from you! Reach me through e-mail or follow me on Twitter (links in the sidebar).
