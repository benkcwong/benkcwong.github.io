# About Me

I am an Epidemiologist at the Centre for Global Health Research in St. Michael's Hospital. We generate and disseminate evidence-based research that aims to quantify the major causes of premature mortality among the world's poorest populations. Our research areas include maternal and child health, tobacco control, health policy/economics, and gender inequalities.

This website is a (not-so-private) hideout for tinkering with quantitative analysis methods, experimenting with data visualization techniques, and improving my scientific communication skills. 

Feel free to say hi and thanks for stopping by!
