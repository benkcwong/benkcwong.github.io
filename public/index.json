India implemented a mass second-dose  measles immunization campaign in 2010. We used interrupted time series and multilevel regression to quantify the campaign’s impact on measles mortality using the nationally representative Million Death Study (including 27,000 child deaths in 1.3  million households surveyed from 2005–2013). 1–59-month measles mortality rates fell significantly more in the campaign states  following launch (27%) versus non-campaign states (11%). Declines were steeper, with steeper declines in girls  than boys and were specific to measles deaths. The campaign did not contribute to any additional declines in mortality from measles in non-campaign states or from pneumonia or diarrhoea. Measles mortality risk was lower for children living in a campaign district (OR 0.6, 99% CI 0.4–0.8) or born in 2009 or later (OR 0.8, 99% CI 0.7–0.9). The campaign averted up to 41,000–56,000 deaths during 2010–13, or 39%–57% of the expected deaths nationally. Elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of measles immunization campaigns in India using a nationally representative sample of 27,000 child deaths","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the importance of KM around dental implants. The electronic databases Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Virtual Health Library (VHL) databases were utilized to search original articles from 2006 to March 2013. The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select the articles were: (1) Human studies published in the English language; (2) Study published in international peer‐viewed journals; (3) Studies evaluated the association between KM width and the peri‐implant tissue health; (4) Studies that have follow up of greater than 12 months; (5) Publication of studies not older than 10 years. The searches retrieved 285 citations. Seven articles fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria. Out of these, three studies were ranked as presenting high methodological quality, and four were judged to be of moderate quality. This systematic review concludes that the presence of an adequate zone of keratinized tissue may be necessary because it was shown to be related to better peri‐implant tissue health. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to support this statement.","tags":[],"title":"Is keratinized mucosa indispensable to maintain peri-implant health?

The information below is aggregated from various source on the Web, with thanks to:\n\rhttps://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/24/rmarkdown-1.html\r\rObjectives\r1. What is RMarkdown\r\r2. Make an RMarkdown file\r\r3. Export an RMarkdown file into many file formats\r\r\rWhat is R Markdown?\rR Markdown allows you to create documents that serve as a neat record of your analysis. In the world of reproducible research, we want other researchers to easily understand what we did in our analysis, otherwise nobody can be certain that you analysed your data properly. You might choose to create an RMarkdown document as an appendix to a paper or project assignment that you are doing, upload it to an online repository such as Github, or simply to keep as a personal record so you can quickly look back at your code and see what you did. RMarkdown presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it, a bit like a notebook.\nRMarkdown uses Markdown. Markdown is a very simple ‘markup’ language which provides methods for creating documents with headers, images, links etc. from plain text files, while keeping the original plain text file easy to read. You can convert Markdown documents to many other file types like .html or .pdf to display the headers, images etc..\n\rDownload R Markdown\rTo get RMarkdown working in RStudio, the first thing you need is the rmarkdown package, which you can get from CRAN by running the following commands in R or RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;)\rlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\rCreate an RMarkdown file\rTo create a new RMarkdown file (.Rmd), select File -\u0026gt; New File -\u0026gt; R Markdown..._ in RStudio, then choose the file type you want to create. For now we will focus on a .html Document, which can be easily converted to other file types later.\nThe newly created .Rmd file comes with basic instructions, but we want to create our own RMarkdown script, so go ahead and delete everything in the example file.\nNow save the .Rmd file to the repository you downloaded earlier from Github.\nNow open the RMarkdown_Tutorial.R practice script from the repository you downloaded earlier in another tab in RStudio and use the instructions below to help you convert this script into a coherent RMarkdown document, bit by bit.\nIf you have any of your own R scripts that you would like to make into an R Markdown document, you can also use those!\n\rThe different parts of an R Markdown file\rThe YAML Header\rAt the top of any RMarkdown script is a YAML header section enclosed by ---. By default this includes a title, author, date and the file type you want to output to. Many other options are available for different functions and formatting, see here for .html options and here for .pdf options. Rules in the header section will alter the whole document. Have a flick through quickly to familiarise yourself with the sorts of things you can alter by adding an option to the YAML header.\nInsert something like this at the top of your new .Rmd script:\n---\rtitle: \u0026quot;Edinburgh Biodiversity\u0026quot;\rauthor: John Doe\rdate: 22/Oct/2016\routput: html_document\r---\rBy default, the title, author, date and output format are printed at the top of your .html document. This is the minimum you should put in your header section.\nNow that we have our first piece of content, we can test the .Rmd file by compiling it to .html. To compile your .Rmd file into a .html document, you should press the Knit button in the taskbar:\n--\rBy default, RStudio opens a separate preview window to display the output of your .Rmd file. If you want the output to be displayed in the Viewer window in RStudio (the same window where you would see plotted figures / packages / file paths), select “View in Pane” from the drop down menu that appears when you click on the Knit button in the taskbar, or in the Settings gear icon drop down menu next to the Knit button.\nA preview appears, and a .html file is also saved to the same folder where you saved your .Rmd file.\n\rCode Chunks\rBelow the YAML header is the space where you will write your code, accompanying explanation and any outputs. Code that is included in your .Rmd document should be enclosed by three backwards apostrophes ``` (grave accents!). These are known as code chunks and look like this:\n\r```r\rnorm \u0026lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)\r```\rInside the curly brackets is a space where you can assign rules for that code chunk. The code chunk above says that the code is R code. We’ll get onto some other curly brace rules later.\nHave a go at grabbing some code from the example R script and inserting it into a code chunk in your .Rmd document.\nYou can run an individual chunk of code at any time by placing your cursor inside the code chunk and selecting Run -\u0026gt; Run Current Chunk:\n--\r\rMore on Code Chunks\rIt’s important to remember when you are creating an RMarkdown file that if you want to run code that refers to an object, for example:\n\r```r\rplot(dataframe)\r```\ryou must include instructions showing what dataframe is, just like in a normal R script. For example:\nA \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)\rB \u0026lt;- c(5, 10, 15, 20)\rdataframe \u0026lt;- data.frame(A, B)\rplot(dataframe)\rOr if you are loading a dataframe from a .csv file, you must include the code in the .Rmd:\n\r```r\rdataframe \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/Code/dataframe.csv\u0026quot;)\r```\rSimilarly, if you are using any packages in your analysis, you will have to load them in the .Rmd file using library() as in a normal R script.\n\r```r\rlibrary(dplyr)\r```\r```\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39;\r```\r```\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;:\r## ## filter, lag\r```\r```\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;:\r## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\r```\r\rHiding code chunks\rIf you don’t want the code of a particular code chunk to appear in the final document, but still want to show the output (e.g. a plot), then you can include echo = FALSE in the code chunk instructions.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;672\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\rSimilarly, you might want to create an object, but not include both the code and the output in the final .html file. To do this you can use, include = FALSE. Be aware though, when making reproducible research it’s often not a good idea to completely hide some part of your analysis:\n\rIn some cases, when you load packages into RStudio, various warning messages such as “Warning: package ‘dplyr’ was built under R version 3.4.4” might appear.

If you have a particularly tall figure, this can mean a really huge graph. In the following example we modify the dimensions of the figure we created above. To manually set the figure dimensions, you can insert an instruction into the curly braces:\n\r```r\rA \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)\rB \u0026lt;- c(5, 10, 15, 20)\rdataframe \u0026lt;- data.frame(A, B)\rplot(dataframe)\r```\r\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;384\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\r\rInserting Tables\rStandard R Markdown\rWhile R Markdown can print the contents of a data frame easily by enclosing the name of the data frame in a code chunk:\n\r```r\rdataframe\r```\r```\r## A B\r## 1 a 5\r## 2 a 10\r## 3 b 15\r## 4 b 20\r```\rthis can look a bit messy, especially with data frames with a lot of columns. Including a formal table requires more effort.\n\rkable() function from knitr package\rThe most aesthetically pleasing and simple table formatting function I have found is kable() in the knitr package. The first argument tells kable to make a table out of the object dataframe and that numbers should have two significant figures. Remember to load the knitr package in your .Rmd file as well.\n\r```r\rlibrary(knitr)\rkable(dataframe, digits = 2)\r```\rA B\r--- ---\ra 5\ra 10\rb 15\rb 20\r\rpander function from pander package\rIf you want a bit more control over the content of your table you can use pander() in the pander package.

Ordered list item\nOrdered list item\r\r\r[Link](https://www.google.com)\nLink\n\r$A = \\pi \\times r^{2}$\n--\rThe $ symbols tell R markdown to use LaTeX equation syntax.\n\rCreating .pdf files in Rmarkdown\rCreating .pdf documents for printing in A4 requires a bit more fiddling around. RStudio uses another document compiling system called LaTeX to make .pdf documents.\nIf you are using Windows, go to MikTeX and download the appropriate “Complete MikTeX Installer” for your system, either 32-bit or 64-bit.\nIf you are using a Mac, go to MacTeX and download the “MacTeX.pkg”.\nRunning these installers will install a version of LaTeX onto your system, which R will then be able to call on to compile the .pdf.\nBecoming familiar with LaTeX syntax will give you a lot more options to make your R Markdown .pdf look pretty, as LaTeX commands are mostly compatible with R Markdown, though some googling is often required.\nTo compile a .pdf instead of a .html document, change output: from html_document to pdf_document.\n\rCommon problems when compiling a .pdf\r\rText is running off the page\r\rAdd a global_options argument at the start of your .Rmd file:\n\rThis code chunk won’t be displayed in the final document due to the include = FALSE call and should be placed immediately after the YAML header to affect everything below that.\ntidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60) defines the margin cutoff point and wraps text to the next line. Play with the value to get it right.\n\rI lose my syntax highlighting\r\rUse the xelatex engine to compile your .pdf:\n- - -\rauthor: John Doe\routput: pdf_document latex_engine: xelatex\r- - -\rBy default, R markdown uses the base LaTeX engine to compile pdfs, but this may limit certain options when it comes to formatting.

When presenting your code, this means you have to make a choice, do you want interactive but messy looking code (.Rmd) or non-interactive but neat looking code (.html, .pdf)? R notebooks provide a file format that combines the interactivity of a .Rmd file with the attractiveness of .html output.\nR notebooks output to the imaginatively named .nb.html format. .nb.html files can be loaded into a web browser to see the output, or loaded into a code editor like RStudio to see the code. You are able to interactively select which code chunks to hide or show code chunks.\nNotebooks use the same syntax as .Rmd files so it is easy to copy and paste the script from a .Rmd into a Notebook. To create a new R Notebook file, select File -\u0026gt; New File -\u0026gt; R Notebook. Create a notebook from your newly created .Rmd file by copying and pasting the script. If you choose to copy and paste the script, make sure that under your YAML header, output: html_notebook instead of output: html_document.\nAlternatively, to turn any existing .Rmd file into an R notebook, add html_notebook: default under the output: argument in the YAML header. It’s okay if you have more than one output type. For example, this code would give you a pdf and an `R notebook.\n--- title: \u0026quot;R Markdown Tutorial Demo\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;John Godlee\u0026quot;\rdate: \u0026quot;30/11/2016\u0026quot;\routput:\rpdf_document: default\rlatex_engine: xelatex\rmainfont: Arial\rhtml_notebook: default\r--- \rTo output to .nb.html, first make sure all your code chunks have been run:\nthen click Preview:\nNotice that with R Notebooks you can still output to .html or .pdf, the same as a .Rmd file.\nR notebooks have only been around for about a couple of years so they’re not perfect yet, but may replace R markdown in the future for many applications.\nDifference between RMarkdown and RNotebooks\rExecuting commands 1 line at a time\rThe first difference between R Markdown and R Notebooks is in the execution of chunks. For R Markdown, when a chunk is executed, all the code is sent to the console at once. But in an R Notebook, only one line at a time is sent. This allows execution to stop if a line raises an error in R Noteboks.\n\rPreview in R Notebooks vs Knit in R Markdown\rR Markdown documents are ‘knitted’, while R Notebooks are ‘previewed’.\nAlthough the notebook preview looks similar to the knitted markdown document, the notebook preview does not execute any code chunks, but only shows you a rendered copy of the Markdown output of your document along with the most recent chunk output. The preview is also generated automatically whenever the notebook is saved. This would be especially useful if we have the preview showing in the Viewer window next to the console. This means that in R Notebooks, we are able to visually assess the output as we develop the document without having to knit the whole document again.\nFor example, with the following code chunk example (from the RMarkdown_Tutorial.R practice script), we are creating a table of species richness for each taxonomic group.\n\r```r\rrichness \u0026lt;- edidiv %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(taxonGroup) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarise(Species_richness = n_distinct(taxonName))\r```\rTo bring up the table output, we can add richness, pander(richness), kable(richness) to the end of that code chunk. If we had initially forgotten to add in either one of those functions, the table would not have been produced in both the knitted markdown document and the notebook preview. Imagine that we are now editing the R Markdown document / R Notebook document to include this function to bring up the table in the outputted document.\nFor RMarkdown: we would type in pander(richness), run that specific code chunk, and then have to click the Knit button in the taskbar to knit the whole document again.\nFor R Notebooks, we type in pander(richness), run that specific code chunk, and save the document, and the preview in the Viewer window would be updated on its own - there is no need to click the Preview button in the taskbar and run the code for the whole document.\n\r\r\r\r","date":1435928400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549119600,"objectID":"066201ae3089bf18fc94b89851af7b86","permalink":"/post/r-rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2015-07-03T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/r-rmarkdown/","section":"post","summary":"This is an RMarkdown ‘how-to’ for me to refer to when I (inevitably) forget how to format my posts.

We can also handle things like estimated population growth rate, e.g., $\\hat{\\lambda}=1.02$. And, $\\sqrt{4}=2$.\n$$\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\Gamma$$\n$$a \\pm b$$ $$x \\ge 15$$ $$a_i \\ge 0~~~\\forall i$$\nMatrix $$A{m,n} = \\begin{pmatrix} a{1,1} \u0026amp; a{1,2} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a{1,n} a{2,1} \u0026amp; a{2,2} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a{2,n} \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots a{m,1} \u0026amp; a{m,2} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a{m,n} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nStatistics The binomial probability: $$f(y|N,p) = \\frac{N!}{y!(N-y)!}\\cdot p^y \\cdot (1-p)^{N-y} = {N}\\choose{y} \\cdot p^y \\cdot (1-p)^{N-y}$$\nTo calculate the mean of \\textit{n} observations of variable \\textit{x}, you can use: $$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i=1}^{n}x{i}$$\nNote that this equation looks quite nice above where it\u0026rsquo;s in display math mode. It is more compact but not quite as nice looking if we present it using inline mode, e.g., $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i=1}^{n}x{i}$.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do the same with the equation for variance. First the inline version, which is $\\sigma^{2} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits{i=1}^{n} \\left(x{i} - \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}$. And then the display mode version: $$\\sigma^{2} = \\frac{\\sum{i=1}^{n} \\left(x{i} - \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}$$\nNext, it\u0026rsquo;s good to look at the equation for covariance to see how it is just a generalization of variance to two variables. An inline version of the equation is $cov{x,y} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits{i=1}^{n}{(x_i-\\overline{x}) \\cdot (yi-\\overline{y})} }{n-1}$. And, the display mode is: $$cov{x,y} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i-\\overline{x}) \\cdot (y_i-\\overline{y})} }{n-1}$$\nAnd, finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll end with the standard deviation. Here\u0026rsquo;s the inline version, $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits{i=1}^{n} \\left(x{i} - \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}}$. And here\u0026rsquo;s the display version. $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits{i=1}^{n} \\left(x{i} - \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}}$$\nThere are helpful online editors to help you learn code for various equations you might want to include. I have found the one at: http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/VisualMathEditor.html to be very useful. You can work out the code there and then copy it over to your RMarkdown document in between dollar signs (1 or 2 on either end depending on whether you want the equation in line or in display mode).\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
